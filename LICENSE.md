#### Introduction

Hereinafter, the term "Software" or "Project" refers to the entire project,
including its source code, libraries, documentation, and compiled files,
all of which are distributed by the licensor and licensed under the terms
of this License.

The Free Contribution License, hereinafter referred to as the "License",
is the primary document governing this Software. The Licensor grants others
the right to participate in the development and modernization of the Project,
distribute it, and make use of it, subject to the terms of this License.

This License is identified by its version, determined by the date of its release.
If a newer version of this License is applied to the Project, the Project shall
be governed by the new License, while previous versions remain valid and continue
to apply to the corresponding earlier versions of the Project.

This License may not be modified, altered, or republished under the same or
similar name. Any use of this License must preserve its complete and unmodified
text, including its version and reference link. Only the original author or 
designated maintainers of the License may release updated versions.

This Software may not be used or distributed in any form if the terms of use or
distribution are violated. No other license may be applied to this Software
except the one currently in effect.

The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, 
including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular 
purpose, and noninfringement. The Licensor shall not be responsible for any indirect or 
consequential damages arising from the use of the Software.

Neither the name of the developer nor the names of the contributors may be used
to endorse or promote products derived from this Software without specific prior
written permission.

#### Terms of Use

  1. This Software is provided to you free of charge. You may freely distribute it 
     in source or binary form, including all documentation and other source files 
     that are part of this Project.

  2. When distributing this Software, whether in source or binary form, you must retain a
     copy of this License along with the Software itself, clearly stating the version of 
     this License.  

     This can be done using comments, file headers, or other appropriate methods. 
     You must provide a reference to this License text along with the corresponding 
     version. It must be clear which components of the distribution are covered by it.

  3. If you use this Software with modifications for commercial purposes, you must obtain 
     prior written permission from the Licensor. This requirement is waived only if you are 
     willing to publish all your changes, derived source code, and relevant files freely 
     under this License.  
     
     All published modifications must preserve the original copyright statement and may not 
     replace or obscure the attribution to the original author(s). Additional attribution 
     for your own contributions is permitted but not required.  
     
     You may use the Software without modification for commercial purposes, provided you 
     comply with all the terms of this License. However, any modifications or derivative 
     works intended for commercial use require prior written permission from the Licensor.  
     
     To request written permission, please contact the Licensor via email, providing 
     a detailed description of your intended commercial use.

  4. Any modifications made to the source code must be properly documented and clearly 
     indicated. This includes inline comments, change logs, or other appropriate forms of 
     documentation to ensure transparency in alterations.  

     This does not apply to entirely new code that does not alter existing source code 
     but instead extends it. In such cases, you may document it at your discretion.

  5. This License does not grant any rights to patents, trademarks, or other intellectual 
     property associated with this Software, except if specifically stated otherwise.

  6. If you violate any provision of this License, your rights to use, modify, and
